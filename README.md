## The Task
Currently our data team processes multiple data files which they manually merge together by
matching unique identifiers, they do sometimes have issues within the data which they manually
deal with. After going through this process, they then produce a results file with the merged data.

## The Requirement
Your task is to automate the current manual merge process of the 5 (small_file_1 â€“ 5) csv files
that are delimiter separated and UTF-8 encoded which have accompanied this task, sent to you
via email in a compressed file called dev.zip.
Your executable file to process the data should provide the ability to pass in multiple files as
arguments and specify an output path for the results file.
